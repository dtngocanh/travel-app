Make a quick photo stop on the way, then continue to Hue \u2013 the former imperial capital of Vietnam. When you arrive, join your leader for a tour of the Imperial Citadel \u2013 this fortress houses the Imperial City and the citadel-within-a-citadel, the Forbidden Purple City. This icon was almost completely destroyed during the Vietnam\/American War, and the ruins and holes left by bombs are a reminder of the destruction that was caused. In your free time you might like to visit Dong Ba Market, which offers locally made goods, fresh produce and tantalising street food."

Leaving Saigon by bus, a two-hour drive brings us to Binh Duc (My Tho), from where we begin cycling through a landscape of waterways, markets, orchards and riverside villages. Here, we can see local cottage industries making rice paper or coconut sweets as they have been for generations. The first 30 kilometres\/18.6 miles of today's ride is on roads with moderate traffic and the remaining 20 kilometres\/12.4 miles are on narrow pathways and routes that our support bus cannot follow."
